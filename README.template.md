# AiZen Translations

[![Translation status](https://weblate.insrt.uk/widgets/revolt/-/web-app/svg-badge.svg)](https://weblate.insrt.uk/engage/revolt/?utm_source=widget)

This repository holds all the translation files for AiZen, feel free to help translate to new languages or fix existing translations at [our Weblate instance](https://weblate.insrt.uk/projects/revolt/web-app/).

Please only PR if you are adding new strings to the source language, otherwise contribute through Weblate.

## Languages

The following table shows languages and people enlisted for verifying certain languages are up to standard.

**Note:** This table only includes languages that are available in the app. If a language has been translated via Weblate and you want it to be added to the app, [please click here](https://github.com/revoltchat/frontend/issues/135).

{{TABLE}}

If you would like to maintain a language, please [open an issue](https://github.com/revoltchat/transations/issues/new/choose) with your request.

### What do I do? 

#### As a language maintainer

As a maintainer, you gain access to the Reviewer role on Weblate. This lets you approve new strings, edit approved strings and accept new suggestions. You may also be mentioned in GitHub issues to approve badges for others.

If you would like to be removed as a maintainer, please create an issue. (You will remain on the contributions list.)

#### As a repository maintainer

There are two different things that need to be handled:

- Languages proposed in [this issue](https://github.com/revoltchat/revite/issues/362) should be added to [Languages.ts](https://github.com/revoltchat/translations/blob/master/Languages.ts).
- Handle issues on this repository:
  - Badge requests: ensure that the language has a maintainer, ping any relevant maintainers to verify translations if you cannot yourself, afterwards the user can be added to the [list here](https://github.com/revoltchat/translations/blob/master/contributors.json)
  - Maintainership requests: ensure the user has sufficient contributions, then add them to the [list here](https://github.com/revoltchat/translations/blob/master/contributors.json)
